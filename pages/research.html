        <p>In the firefighter process on a graph, a fire breaks out at turn 0. At each subsequent turn, some 
          number of firefighters are placed on vertices that are not on fire, and the fire spreads to all 
          unprotected vertices adjacent to a burning vertex. In an infinite graph, the main goal is to contain 
          the fire in finitely many steps.
        </p>

        <p>This project focused on the minimum number of firefighters needed per turn to contain the fire in 
          the infinite hexagonal grid and certain infinite forests. For the infinite hexagonal grid, we provide 
          a strategy to contain the fire using a single additional firefighter at some turn. The infinite 
          forests we consider use hot strategies and birth sequences. Given infinite trees with specified 
          birth sequences, we show a sufficient and necessary condition for containability. Additionally, we 
          show that many well-studied properties of graphs fail to affect the graph's containability.

        <p>Our work was published in the journal <em>Discrete Applied Mathematics</em>.</p>

        <p>An automated theorem prover is a program that takes as input a statment and <em>decides</em> (i.e. 
          proves or disproves) it. Theorem provers can be very useful: computers are reliable, and they never 
          get tired or bored, allowing us to quickly explore new ideas. Though it is impossible to decide 
          <em>all</em> statements, we can still use theorem provers to solve many interesting problems.
        </p>

        <p>This project focused on building Pecan, a system for automated theorem proving that represents 
          logical predicates using Büchi automata. Pecan is capable of proving any statement expressed solely 
          in terms of Büchi automata and first order logic connectives - In particular, it is powerful enough 
          to decide any statement in Presburger arithmetic, the first order theory of the natural numbers with 
          addition and comparison.

        <p>The Stern Sequence is defined by the initial conditions s(0) = 0, s(1) = 1, and the recursive relations 
          s(2n) = s(n), s(2n + 1) = s(n) + s(n + 1) for all n greater than 0. We can envision the sequence in a 
          similar manner as we do Pascal's triangle, only each time we add two adjacent entries in one row to 
          generate a new entry in the next row, we also carry those original two entries down to the next row 
          with us, forming Stern's diatomic array.
        </p>

        <p>We present results for the maximum and average of each row for the general case, as well as studying 
          the case with a = 3, b = 7 substituted into the diatomic array defined herin. We also make several 
          conjectures about L_m(r), the mth largest value in the rth row. In addition, we introduce repeated 
          connections to the Fibonacci sequence as well as the Jacobsthal sequence.
