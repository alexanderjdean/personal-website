            Hi! My name is Alex. I’m a problem solver and I’m always looking for interesting and challenging 
            problems to solve. I am 21-years old.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            I’m currently a software engineer at Capital One — I create and deploy machine learning tools 
            to prevent credit card fraud. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
            I’m also passionate about creating artificial superintelligence, encouraging civic engagement, 
            overhauling democratic government, and restructuring society to provide more time and opportunity 
            for everyone.
        </p>
